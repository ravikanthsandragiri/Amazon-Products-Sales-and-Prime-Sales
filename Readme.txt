I'm excited to share my latest work on two interactive Power BI dashboards, focusing on Amazon's diverse business streams!

Amazon Products Sales Dashboard:
KPIs: Year-to-Date (YTD) Sales, Quarter-to-Date (QTD) Sales, YTD Products Sold, and YTD Reviews.

Visuals used are:
YTD Sales by Month and Week 
Sales by Product Category 
YTD Sales and Reviews by Product 

Interactive Slicers: Filter by Product Category and Quarter to drill down into the insights.


Amazon Prime Sales Dashboard:
KPIs: Total Sales, Total Number of Movies, and Total Reviews.
Visuals used are:
Total Movie Count by Release Year 
Total Sales by Movie Type and Quality 
Top 5 Movies by Total Sales and Reviews 

Interactive Slicers: Filter by Quality, Director, and Movie Type to explore the data further.

These dashboards not only provide a comprehensive overview of sales and customer engagement but also enable users to slice and dice the data for detailed analysis.
